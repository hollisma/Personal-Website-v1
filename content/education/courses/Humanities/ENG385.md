Analyzes children's texts on a deep level. Much more content and much more interesting than one would think. Here's an 8 page paper I wrote analyzing one of the most popular picture books of all time, <a href="../education/It's_OK_Stuwwelpeter.pdf" target="_blank">It's OK Stuwwelpeter</a>. And here's an app called [Synthesaurus](http://synthesaurus.surge.sh/) that I built to analyze and find synonyms to help children's authors, and here's a <a href="../education/Synthesaurus_and_Children's_Literature.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> on the relationship between Synthesaurus and children' literature.
