title: Hey Look a Blog!

This is a blog post. For the longest time, I've wanted to write one of these in my very own blog. 
I have a lot of thoughts. Some of them make people go WTF and some of them could actually be useful 
to others. Some are both. In fact, most of my thoughts make me go WTF, yet I still learn from them 
all the time. I'll share a few other reasons as to why I'm doing this, and then talk about how I am 
going to blog, mostly as a note for myself. If anyone is reading this, I would recommend 
considering my reasons for starting a blog in the context of your own life to make this read a bit 
more interesting and to potentially motivate you to pursue your own form of self expression. 

So why did I start a blog? Well I have a lot of thoughts. Most of them are boring, and most of 
them are forgotten. For the thoughts that are neither boring nor forgotten, they're probably a 
fundamental part of me now, whether they be in my personality, interests, subconscious, or 
wherever else they find themselves after they're flung from the storm in my brain. The application 
process for becoming one of my core thoughts is quite inefficient â€” it mainly consists of a 
lottery to get chosen, then getting thrown into a messy room full of other thoughts with mold 
stretching from thought to thought. Blogging will hopefully become a way of carefully selecting 
which thoughts I want to cultivate and gently plant them into my brain so that they can grow 
healthily. After all, I'm pretty sure my consciousness is just grape vines tangled together to 
resemble an organized spec of existence, so I want to enjoy the highest quality grapes while 
they're here. Blogging is also an outlet for my wacky, convoluted analogies so I apologize if 
they're hard to understand; hopefully I'll get better at them. 

To summarize in normal English, blogging provides a place for me to jot down my thoughts and 
clearly articulate them, hopefully helping me to understand and improve myself, as well as my 
existential angst. 

That was a super general statement, so here are some more specifics. 

- I'm generally a very passive person and will perform the "go with the flow" move for most of my 
decisions that involve social pressure. I want to change this by proactively defining my thoughts 
and self through blogging.
- Even though I'm socially passive, I ironically have a boatload of critiques about people and the 
world that also apply to myself, so I want some mechanism to remind myself that I'm an unripe 
human bean and to keep myself accountable for my thoughts.
- One of these hypocracies is binging YouTube and playing video games. I've been hooked to these 
for a while, and now I'm soaking and rotting in all this excess dopamine. Hopefully, this blog 
with make me engage in a more calming activity and unjade myself from the hyperstimulation that is 
the internet.
- In addition to keeping my thoughts and actions in check, I also want to blog as a means for 
monitoring and accelerating my improvement. Being better than the me that wrote that previous 
sentence is a pursuit that is one of the most fulfilling things in my life, and blogging will 
encourage me to introspect and analyze my life with more passion and fewer biases.
- Finally, I suck at writing. Just getting to this paragraph has taken a couple years. The writing 
part has taken a little less time, but as the failed attempt of that joke has shown, I have a lot 
of room to improve in conveying my thoughts and writing good English. Also, imo communication is 
one of the most important and underrated skills in modern society, so I hope to get better at it.

Hopefully, I've convinced myself to keep writing now. Another selling point of a blog is that 
it can be whatever you want it to be. You can write essays and memoirs or just track habits and 
goals. You can even build games or programs and just talk about how I made them. 

Another benefit of writing a blog is that I'll be able to write in my own "voice." I'm not sure 
what that means yet, but I assume it has something to do with becoming a more refined individual, 
which sounds ok. I have a tendency to overthink, so there'll probably be a lot of nuance in the writing that doesn't initially make sense. In any case, I'll try to exercise and experiment with my 
vocal cords and write in a tone that suits me, which is probably something like a really informal, 
somewhat inconsistent meta commentary of a caveman documenting his search for a needle in an overgrown forest.
