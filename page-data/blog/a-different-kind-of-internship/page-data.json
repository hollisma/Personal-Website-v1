If we consider the technical skills one would learn in this type of\nwork, it's nothing that one can't learn on their own, as evidenced by the trillions of fullstack\ntutorials and the resources provided by the open source community. So what happens if instead of\nparticipating in a traditional internship, you use the summer to optimize your own education?</p>\n<p>This is exactly what I wanted to find out when I told recruiters that I wouldn't be doing an\ninternship this summer. My plan was simple: find a bunch of interesting things and learn about\nthem. I made a list of a dozen areas of computer science and found free video courses and text\nguides that covered the basics of each area. Each course has around 20 hour-long videos, so\nwatching at 2x speed while taking notes and reviewing for 5 hours a day would mean covering all\nthe content in 4 days. Taking another 3 days to create a project using the concepts learned would\nmean that completing a course would take a week, perfect for learned a dozen areas in the dozen\nweeks of summer. <a href=\"#fn1\" class=\"footnote_small\">[1]<span id=\"a1\" class=\"anchor\" /></a></p>\n<p>The projects would also be structured so that they build upon each other. For example I want\nto learn game development, animation, and NLP, so I could make a game, then add animations to it,\nthen incoporate NLP. Doing this would result in a broad survey of 12 areas of computer\nscience while completing interdisciplinary and fulfilling projects - meanwhile a traditional\ninternship would focus on accomplishing an arbitrary task usually in narrow scope and learning. </p>\n<p>Wait but how much could you actually learn without an instructor or more structured assignments?\nYou aren't reinforcing your knowledge with exams or class discussions so what's the point of\nlearning all this then forgetting about it? The reason I chose to do this wasn't to learn in depth\nabout any area, but to gain a general understanding of the landscape and build lots of small nodes\nof knowledge where I can then build from and between. When we encounter something new, we need to\nattach some context and structure to it to prevent it from floating out into space. Learning\nbroadly is a powerful tool that maximizes the number of nodes that act as scaffolding from which\nto structure other information. There's another blog post in here talking about\nlearning broadly and interdisciplinary studies that considers the cons and caveats, but I'll save\nthat for later. In short, innovation seems to be made from deep knowledge that lets you identify\nproblems more easily, then using shallow knowledge from other areas to make\nquicker and better connections, where you can then do more research as needed. </p>\n<p>Now let's take a step back and this about this. If Princeton suddenly said \"hey we're doing a 3\nmonth course teaching you most of the computer science you would've learned in 4 years,\" people would\ngo absolutely bonkers. But this is almost reality. Most of the courses a CS undergrad takes will be\nintroductory courses that briefly goes over basic concepts and ideas in a subfield. <a href=\"#fn2\" class=\"footnote_small\">[2]<span id=\"a2\" class=\"anchor\" /></a> Our 12 week\naccelerator does just that, and if we factor in diminishing returns of the assignments and\nlectures in a 4 year study, then our DIY education has significant merit for learning a similar\namount while taking 93.75% less time, and with well planned projects can even make your bank\nbalance move the other way. </p>\n<p>There are unique benefits of a longer education in that retention should be higher and you get to\nfinish more projects in each subfield, but the beauty of modern computer science education comes\nin the form of the accessability of information and code. If you want to learn about a concept or\nfigure out how to build something, all you need are words to phrase your question and to then\ndirect it at Google. Shallow knowledge becomes almost as powerful as medium-level knowledge as\nlong as you're motivated and have trained your learning muscles. </p>\n<p>To summarize, in the context of learning and preparing yourself to learn computer science,\nspending a summer independently studying and programming seems to be magnitudes more efficient\nthan learning through an internship or at a university. Unfortunately, I will not be able to test\nthis theory out. When I told my recruiters that I wouldn't be doing an internship and would\ninstead be learning on my own, one startup offered me a different kind of internship.  </p>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 530px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 64%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Pixel art of a brain\"\n        title=\"Take a break and enjoy some pixel art :)\"\n        src=\"/static/c49c0e8666d3bababe78551ce9c47a74/b6a9b/Brain.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/c49c0e8666d3bababe78551ce9c47a74/772e8/Brain.png 200w,\n/static/c49c0e8666d3bababe78551ce9c47a74/e17e5/Brain.png 400w,\n/static/c49c0e8666d3bababe78551ce9c47a74/b6a9b/Brain.png 530w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">Take a break and enjoy some pixel art :)</figcaption>\n  </figure></p>\n<p>My goal for this summer is to learn efficiently, and for me, learning is done best with the\nabsence of deadlines and with the freedom to explore and enjoy the amazing theme parks of computer\nscience. A traditional internship is therefore completely unoptimal for my learning, which\n(hopefully) applies to others. <a href=\"#fn3\" class=\"footnote_small\">[3]<span id=\"a3\" class=\"anchor\" /></a></p>\n<p>Up to here is where my thought process was until a startup offered me a research role. I was\nconfused as to how I could do research for them, as the only research I've done was just learning\nfor myself. It turns out this is exactly what they were thinking. Whenever I research a topic,\nit's either to apply it to a project or for my general interest, so why not take my interests and\nthen research and apply them to a company? </p>\n<p>I was initially very skeptical of this as agreeing to work for them meant that I would be subject\nto their vision and decisions, however, I realized that this would be an unpaid internship so\nthere would be no contract binding me to whatever bureaucracy exists within the company. Our\nrelationship would be a symbiotic partnership where I would be free to explore my interests and\napply my learning to existing datasets and applications to make real-world impact while the other\nparty would receive valuable insight into technologies they can incorporate into their current\nplatforms or utilize some time in the future. </p>\n<p>That was a mouthful, but basically it's a win-win with minimal downsides if both parties are\nrespectful. For the self-education mentioned earlier, each period of learning is followed by a\nperiod of applying, and having a research internship is a unique opportunity to wield the\nknowledge you've acquired and use it to solve a real, potentially messy problem. It's perfect\ntraining for your interdisciplinary learning muscles, not to mention the practice in communicating\nand turning abstract ideas into code and the feedback you'll receive on your code and ideas. The\nbest part about it is that you have all the benefits of a traditional internship (as mentioned above,\nalso including mentorship) while having complete freedom to take yourself in whatever\ndirection you want since the goal is just to improve the company's existing position. </p>\n<p>Speaking of which, the company also gets an amazing deal out of this as they receive feedback on\ntheir own product and ideas, and for small startups especially, everything is always super hectic\nso having a fresh pair of eyes could prove beneficial. If the intern is passionate and resourseful\nenough, they could even create the next big product that the company pushes out — it's like a\nstartup within a startup! </p>\n<p>Man I'm convinced that this is a great idea, but why don't more companies and students do this?\nFor students, lack of green paper is probably a large deterrant. For those that cannot\nafford not taking a paid position, I wish you the best of luck, skill, and health. For everyone\nelse, the best way to be able to paint your house green is to create a scalable paint generator,\nwhich often requires solving a problem, which in return can be done through innovation. Jobs that\nscale linearly with time should be a stepping stone, a waypoint that empowers you to create your\nown green machine, so what better way to gain a sea of shallow knowledge to help you innovate than\npursuing self-education or a research role? </p>\n<p>For companies, taking on a research intern seems unreliable as some may provide great value to the\ncompany while others won't accomplish anything. It's like investing in a startup, but instead of throwing\nmoney at interns, you simply need to acquaint them with your company and codebase. Very little\nrisk and time invested for decent expected reward. </p>\n<p>The most difficult but essential aspect of this relationship is mutual respect. In addition to\nunderstanding that the intern is there to learn and grow, the company must be willing to foster\nthat mindset without putting extra work on the intern that does not align with their learning.\nIt's difficult and rare to have these two goals align, but with proper communication, optimisim,\nand a little luck, it can defintiely become something unique. <a href=\"#fn4\" class=\"footnote_small\">[4]<span id=\"a4\" class=\"anchor\" /></a></p>\n<p>In conclusion, I hope more students and companies are willing to engage in this symbiotic\nrelationship as there is great potential for education and innovation. For those desparately\nsearching for something in the internship-deprived pandemic, I hope you found it here. Best of\nluck, skill, and health. </p>\n<p><br><br><br></p>\n<h3>Footnotes</h3>\n<p>1<span id=\"fn1\" class=\"anchor\"></span>: Just a note: this is not for the faint of heart. I am fortunate to have\nintrinsic motivation to learn on my own and have lots of experience with it as well. An ambitious\nproject like this requires lots of discipline and energy and is not for most. <a href=\"#a1\">↩</a></p>\n<p>2<span id=\"fn2\" class=\"anchor\"></span>: I'm talking strictly about learning here so connections with professors and other students do\nnot apply. Taking grad courses brings more value, but is not applicable to most undergrads. Also\nthis post is written assuming basic programming skills. Skills such as debugging, googling, and\nproblem solving are grouped under programming fundamentals as I do not see how one could\nmeaningfully program without these. If you think that learning a field in a week cannot be called\nlearning, you are probably right. I'm referring to a survey of topics rather than understanding\nthe topics, which is what most introductory classes to anyway. <a href=\"#a2\">↩</a></p>\n<p>3<span id=\"fn3\" class=\"anchor\"></span>: I say hopefully not because I wish internships to be poor learning experiences, but because I\nhope others learn best when they're curious and excited to jump down rabbit holes. This type of\nlearning encourages exploration and by extension innovation, not to mention how exhilarating it\nis. One unfortunate part of traditional internships is that we generally partake in them right\nwhen our CS muscles are starting to develop, when we are unsure of where or how we want to train\nthem. Doing something more explorative seems like a good way to find what we excel at and/or are\npassionate about, so I hope more people realize this and pursue their own form of learning,\nwhether it be within or without an internship. <a href=\"#a3\">↩</a></p>\n<p>4<span id=\"fn4\" class=\"anchor\"></span>: I say hopefully not because I wish internships to be poor learning experiences, but because I\nAcademia is perfect for unpaid internships as the goal of the employer is konwledge, aligning very\nwell if the intern's goal is also to learn. With companies, the goals of learning and making money\noften butt heads. <a href=\"#a4\">↩</a></p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/a-different-kind-of-internship/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/hey-look-a-blog/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hey Look a Blog!"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/purpose-of-life/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Purpose of Life"}}}}}
