For the longest time, I've wanted to write one of these in my very own blog.\nI have a lot of thoughts. Some of them make people go WTF and some of them could actually be useful\nto others. Some are both. In fact, most of my thoughts make me go WTF, yet I still learn from them\nall the time. I'll share a few other reasons as to why I'm doing this, and then talk about how I am\ngoing to blog, mostly as a note for myself. If anyone is reading this, I would recommend\nconsidering my reasons for starting a blog in the context of your own life to make this read a bit\nmore interesting and to potentially motivate you to pursue your own form of self expression. </p>\n<p>So why did I start a blog? Well I have a lot of thoughts. Most of them are boring, and most of\nthem are forgotten. For the thoughts that are neither boring nor forgotten, they're probably a\nfundamental part of me now, whether they be in my personality, interests, subconscious, or\nwherever else they find themselves after they're flung from the storm in my brain. The application\nprocess for becoming one of my core thoughts is quite inefficient â€” it mainly consists of a\nlottery to get chosen, then getting thrown into a messy room full of other thoughts with mold\nstretching from thought to thought. Blogging will hopefully become a way of carefully selecting\nwhich thoughts I want to cultivate and gently plant them into my brain so that they can grow\nhealthily. After all, I'm pretty sure my consciousness is just grape vines tangled together to\nresemble an organized spec of existence, so I want to enjoy the highest quality grapes while\nthey're here. Blogging is also an outlet for my wacky, convoluted analogies so I apologize if\nthey're hard to understand; hopefully I'll get better at them. </p>\n<p>To summarize in normal English, blogging provides a place for me to jot down my thoughts and\nclearly articulate them, hopefully helping me to understand and improve myself, as well as my\nexistential angst. </p>\n<p>That was a super general statement, so here are some more specifics. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>I'm generally a very passive person and will perform the \"go with the flow\" move for most of my\ndecisions that involve social pressure. I want to change this by proactively defining my thoughts\nand self through blogging.</li>\n<li>Even though I'm socially passive, I ironically have a boatload of critiques about people and the\nworld that also apply to myself, so I want some mechanism to remind myself that I'm an unripe\nhuman bean and to keep myself accountable for my thoughts.</li>\n<li>One of these hypocracies is binging YouTube and playing video games. I've been hooked to these\nfor a while, and now I'm soaking and rotting in all this excess dopamine. Hopefully, this blog\nwith make me engage in a more calming activity and unjade myself from the hyperstimulation that is\nthe internet.</li>\n<li>In addition to keeping my thoughts and actions in check, I also want to blog as a means for\nmonitoring and accelerating my improvement. Being better than the me that wrote that previous\nsentence is a pursuit that is one of the most fulfilling things in my life, and blogging will\nencourage me to introspect and analyze my life with more passion and fewer biases.</li>\n<li>Finally, I suck at writing. Just getting to this paragraph has taken a couple years. The writing\npart has taken a little less time, but as the failed attempt of that joke has shown, I have a lot\nof room to improve in conveying my thoughts and writing good English. Also, imo communication is\none of the most important and underrated skills in modern society, so I hope to get better at it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hopefully, I've convinced myself to keep writing now. Another selling point of a blog is that\nit can be whatever you want it to be. You can write essays and memoirs or just track habits and\ngoals. You can even build games or programs and just talk about how I made them. </p>\n<p>Another benefit of writing a blog is that I'll be able to write in my own \"voice.\" I'm not sure\nwhat that means yet, but I assume it has something to do with becoming a more refined individual,\nwhich sounds ok. I have a tendency to overthink, so there'll probably be a lot of nuance in the\nwriting that doesn't initially make sense. In any case, I'll try to exercise and experiment with my\nvocal cords and write in a tone that suits me, which is probably something like a really informal,\nsomewhat inconsistent meta commentary of a caveman documenting his search for a needle in an\novergrown forest.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/hey-look-a-blog/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/a-different-kind-of-internship/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A Different Kind of Internship"}}}}}
